# Material for the PyPSA(-Eur) modelling workshop
*24-25 November 2025, Gothenburg, Sweden*

This repository contains PyPSA(-Eur) materials for a workshop organized for a broad audience of researchers and industry stakeholders interested in energy system modelling.

The workshop is hosted by **RISE (The research institute of Sweden)** (Dr. Markus Millinger).
The workshop is co-hosted by the **ENSYS research group at TU Berlin** — Fabian Neumann and Iegor Riepin — with support from the **RESILIENT project**.
